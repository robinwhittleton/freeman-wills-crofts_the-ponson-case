			<p>The doubts which Inspector Tanner had experienced as to the truth of Austin’s statement were short-lived. After a careful consideration of the story, Austin was subjected to a most searching examination on small details⁠—such points and so many of them as no trio of conspirators could possibly have foreseen and provided for. Cosgrove, who made a statement similar to Austin’s, was also tested upon these points, and his answers convinced the authorities that at last the truth was known. At his request the false confession of blackmail, signed “Edward Dale,” was given up by Miss Belcher, to whom it had been handed for safety. But what cleared the last shreds of doubt from the minds of those concerned was the statement of Dale. Not only did his testimony agree with that of the others, both generally and on the small matters in question, but he went further than either of them. He confessed fully that his action had been the cause of the tragedy, stating, which neither of the others, had done, that he had actually pushed Sir William back. He swore most positively he had no idea of injuring the manufacturer, nor had he noticed the rope or thought about the other’s tripping.</p>
			<p>It was clear to the authorities that with any ordinary jury the defence would win, and indeed, both Tanner, his Chief, and the Crown Prosecutor themselves believed the explanation given by the three prisoners. The case against Austin and Cosgrove was therefore unconditionally withdrawn, and they were set at liberty.</p>
			<p>Against Dale the matter was not so clear, a charge of manslaughter being considered. At last, however, it was decided he could not be proved guilty of this, his only punishable offence being blackmail. But as Austin and Cosgrove resolutely refused to prosecute, the charge was not proceeded with, and Dale also was set free. The cousins even agreed to pay him the £320 a year he had been promised, though they would not purchase for him the annuity.</p>
			<p>All the cases thus collapsing, the Yard authorities did not consider it necessary to make known the illegality of Sir William’s marriage, and the secret was therefore preserved.</p>
			<p>A few weeks, later two announcements were to be seen in the fashionable papers. First came:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“<b>Ponson⁠—Drew.</b> <time datetime="1920-12-29"><abbr>Dec.</abbr> 29, 1920</time>, at <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s, Hanover Square, by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> Sydney Smallwood, cousin of the bride, Austin Herbert, son of the late Sir William Ponson of Luce Manor, Halford, to Lois Evelyn, eldest daughter of Arthur Drew, of Elm Cottage, Halford.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="continued">Below it was another announcement:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“<b>Ponson⁠—Belcher.</b> <time datetime="1920-12-29"><abbr>Dec.</abbr> 29, 1920</time> at <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s, Hanover Square, by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> Sydney Smallwood, Cosgrove Seaton, son of the late John Ponson of Oaklands, Gateshead, to Elizabeth Clare (Betty), youngest daughter of the late <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> Stanford Belcher, of <abbr>St.</abbr> Aiden’s Rectory, Nottingham.”</p>
			</blockquote>
